              </p>
              <p>I am Pranav and I am currently working as a Machine Learning Research Lead at Dayta AI.
                I graduated from Hong Kong University of Science and Technology studying Big Data Technology. My email is cs.pranav.a (at) gmail.com.
              </p>
              <p>Broadly, my interests are in NLP (Natural Language Processing) and AI ethics.</p>

            <p>In the realm of NLP, my particular focus revolves around tokenization learning and multilinguality. Currently, my work centers on developing subword models in multilingual tasks, with a specific emphasis on addressing the following issues:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>How can we develop tokenization methods that effectively tackle the challenges of sparsity and skewness?</li>
              <li>How do different language families influence one another within multilingual datasets, and how can we leverage this knowledge to create improved tokenization methods tailored for multilingual models?</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Regarding AI ethics, my main areas of interest include conference inclusivity, queerness in AI, and data sovereignty. Presently, my research efforts are concentrated on the following topics:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>How can community-based approaches enhance inclusivity at conferences?</li>
              <li>In cases where control over digital identity, as manifested in datasets, models, and algorithms, has been taken away from queer individuals, what tools can be devised to counteract this?</li>
              <li>Why do deadnames occur in citations of publications, and what tools can be developed to prevent the circulation of deadnames and outdated information?</li>
            </ul>

              <p>Abstract: We present Queer in AI as a case study for community-led participatory design in AI. We examine how participatory design and intersectional tenets started and shaped this community's programs over the years. We discuss different challenges that emerged in the process, look at ways this organization has fallen short of operationalizing participatory and intersectional principles, and then assess the organization's impact. Queer in AI provides important lessons and insights for practitioners and theorists of participatory methods broadly through its rejection of hierarchy in favor of decentralization, success at building aid and programs by and for the queer community, and effort to change actors and institutions outside of the queer community. Finally, we theorize how communities like Queer in AI contribute to the participatory design in AI more broadly by fostering cultures of participation in AI, welcoming and empowering marginalized participants, critiquing poor or exploitative participatory practices, and bringing participation to institutions outside of individual research projects. Queer in AI's work serves as a case study of grassroots activism and participatory methods within AI, demonstrating the potential of community-led participatory methods and intersectional praxis, while also providing challenges, case studies, and nuanced insights to researchers developing and using participatory methods.

              <p>Abstract: Queer in AIâ€™s demographic survey reveals that most queer scientists in our community do not feel completely welcome in conferences and their work environments, with the main reasons being a lack of queer community and role models. Over the past years, Queer in AI has worked towards eliminating these issues, yet we have observed that the voices of marginalized queer communities, especially transgender, non-binary folks and queer BIPOC folks have been neglected. Furthermore, the coronavirus pandemic has introduced many novel scenarios including the ubiquity of virtual conferences, with which D&I chairs may not have prior experience. Queer in AI frequently gets inquires about making virtual conferences more inclusive from both conference organizers and queer community organizers. The purpose of this document is to provide a tutorial for D&I organizers on how to make virtual conferences queer friendly.

              <p>Abstract: Simplified Chinese to Traditional Chinese character conversion is a common preprocessing step in Chinese NLP. Despite this, current approaches have poor performance because they do not take into account that a simplified Chinese character can correspond to multiple traditional characters. Here, we propose a model that can disambiguate between mappings and convert between the two scripts. The model is based on subword segmentation, two language models, as well as a method for mapping between subword sequences. We further construct benchmark datasets for topic classification and script conversion. Our proposed method outperforms previous Chinese Character conversion approaches by 6 points in accuracy. These results are further confirmed in a downstream application, where 2kenize is used to convert pretraining dataset for topic classification. An error analysis reveals that our method's particular strengths are in dealing with code-mixing and named entities.

              <p>Abstract: Ranking functions in information retrieval are often used in search engines to extract the relevant answers to the query. 
                This paper makes use of this notion of information retrieval and applies onto the problem domain of cognate detection. 
                The main contributions of this paper are: (1) positional tokenization, which incorporates the sequential notion; 
                (2) graphical error modelling, which calculates the morphological shifts. 
                The current research work only distinguishes whether a pair of words are cognates or not. 
                However, we also study if we could predict a possible cognate from the given input. 
                Our study shows that language modelling based retrieval functions with positional tokenization and error modelling tend to give better results than competing baselines.
