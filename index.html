              <p>Simplified Chinese to Traditional Chinese character conversion is a common preprocessing step in Chinese NLP. 
                Despite this, current approaches have poor performance because they do not take into account that a simplified Chinese character can 
                correspond to multiple traditional characters.
                Here, we propose a novel model that can disambiguate between mappings and convert between the two scripts. 
                The model is based on subword segmentation, two language models, as well as a method for mapping between subword sequences.
                We further construct benchmark datasets for topic classification and script conversion.
                Our proposed method outperforms previous Chinese Character Conversion approaches by 6 points in accuracy. 
                These results are further confirmed in a downstream application, where 2kenize is used to preprocess text for topic classification. 
                An error analysis reveals that our method's particular strengths are in dealing with code mixing and named entities.

              <p>Ranking functions in information retrieval are often used in search engines to extract the relevant answers to the query. 
                This paper makes use of this notion of information retrieval and applies onto the problem domain of cognate detection. 
                The main contributions of this paper are: (1) positional tokenization, which incorporates the sequential notion; 
                (2) graphical error modelling, which calculates the morphological shifts. 
                The current research work only distinguishes whether a pair of words are cognates or not. 
                However, we also study if we could predict a possible cognate from the given input. 
                Our study shows that language modelling based retrieval functions with positional tokenization and error modelling tend to give better results than competing baselines.

              <p>Ranking functions used in information retrieval are primarily used in the search engines and they are often adopted for various language processing applications. 
                This project introduces some novel heuristics combined with probabilistic retrieval functions and are employed in the domain of approximate string similarity problem. 
                A lot of algorithms have been proposed in the literature to solve approximate string similarity problems, however none of them makes use of probabilistic retrieval functions. 
                We are the first to explore the intersection between these two areas and propose heuristic designs to resolve this problem. First we propose chunking heuristic function, BREAK. 
                We show the variants BREAK-1, 2, OFF which splits up the terms with the sequential notion. Then we propose BREAK-n which generalizes these variants and scales to larger datasets. 
                In order to relate these split ups, we propose a graphical error modelling heuristics MAKE over the BREAK variants. 
                Finally, we propose TAKE curve, a novel feature engineering probabilistic distribution which replaces the prevalent normalization heuristics. 
                Taking the advantage of flexibility over the choice of heuristics, we assess the variants on the cognate detection, mutant identification, and isolated spelling correction based problems. 
                In the extensive evaluation methods, we found that our designs perform better than prevalent heuristics and are robust against database characteristics.

              <p>In this paper, we have studied the bit partitioning schemes for the multicell multiple-input and single-output (MISO) infrastructure. 
                Zero forcing beamforming is used to null out the interference signals and the random vector quantization, quantizes the channel vectors. 
                For minimal feedback period (MFP), the upper bound of rate loss is calculated and optimal bit partitioning among the channels is shown. 
                For adaptive feedback period scheme (AFP), joint optimization schemes of feedback period and bit partitioning are proposed. 
                Finally, we compare the sum rate efficiency of each scheme and conclude that minimal feedback period outperforms other schemes.
